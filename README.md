# Eventium

A Haskell library for building event-sourced applications with CQRS.

## Overview

Eventium provides composable, type-safe abstractions for event sourcing: event stores with optimistic concurrency, pure projections, command handlers, process managers, event subscriptions, and pluggable storage backends. It is a modernized fork of `eventful`, updated for GHC 9.10.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Enter dev environment (requires Nix with flakes)
nix develop

# Build everything
just build

# Run all tests
just test
```

### Using Eventium in your project

Add `eventium-core` plus a storage backend to your dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - eventium-core >= 0.1.0
  - eventium-sqlite >= 0.1.0 # or eventium-postgresql, eventium-memory
```

### Minimal working example

```haskell
import Eventium
import Eventium.Store.Memory

main :: IO ()
main = do
  tvar <- eventMapTVar
  let writer = runEventStoreWriterUsing atomically (tvarEventStoreWriter tvar)
      reader = runEventStoreReaderUsing atomically (tvarEventStoreReader tvar)

  -- Apply a command through a command handler
  result <- applyCommandHandler writer reader myCommandHandler aggregateId myCommand
  case result of
    Left err -> print err
    Right events -> print events
```

## Key Abstractions

- **Projection** -- Pure fold: seed state + event handler. Rebuilds aggregate or read-model state from events.
- **CommandHandler** -- Validates a command against current state and produces events or a domain error. `applyCommandHandlerWithCache` integrates with `ProjectionCache` for faster aggregate loading.
- **EventStoreReader / EventStoreWriter** -- Polymorphic over key, position, monad, and event types. Supports versioned (per-aggregate) and global (cross-aggregate) streams.
- **ProjectionCache** -- Snapshot store for aggregate state, avoiding full event replay. `snapshotEventHandler` auto-updates the cache as events are written.
- **ReadModel** -- Abstraction for queryable persistent views driven by the global event stream. Users define schema and event handlers; the library manages checkpointing. `rebuildReadModel` replays all events for one-shot rebuilds.
- **ProcessManager** -- Coordinates long-running workflows across aggregates. Reacts to events with pure `[ProcessManagerEffect]` values (including `IssueCommandWithCompensation` for saga compensation).
- **CommandDispatcher** -- Routes commands to aggregates and reports `CommandDispatchResult` (`CommandSucceeded` | `CommandFailed`). `commandHandlerDispatcher` provides list-based multi-aggregate routing.
- **EventHandler** -- Composable event consumer with `Contravariant`, `Semigroup`, and `Monoid` instances.
- **EventPublisher** -- Decouples post-write notification from the store writer. `publishingEventStoreWriter` wraps a writer to auto-dispatch after each write.
- **EventSubscription** -- Push-based event delivery. `pollingSubscription` polls the global stream at a configurable interval.
- **Codec** -- Bidirectional event encoding/decoding with JSON support and TH-generated sum-type codecs.
- **SchemaEvolution** -- Upcast-on-read event schema evolution against an immutable log: a versioned payload envelope plus a registry of pure single-hop upcasters (`atKey`, `addFieldIfAbsent`, `renameField`, `removeField`). `upcastingValueCodec` normalizes older stored events to the current shape on read without ever rewriting the log; version-skipping runs more hops.

## Examples

Working examples live in a separate repository,
[eventium-hs/examples](https://github.com/eventium-hs/examples), demonstrating
increasing complexity:

- **Counter CLI** — minimal single-file example: bounded counter with in-memory store.
- **Cafe** — restaurant ordering system (inspired by [Edument's CQRS tutorial](http://cqrs.nu/tutorial)): tab management, chef todo list as a polling read model.
- **Bank** — full CQRS application: accounts, customers, money transfers via process manager, read models, event publishing.

## Build System

Nix + Cabal with GHC 9.10.3. Cabal files are generated from `package.yaml` via hpack.

```bash
just build          # cabal build all
just test           # cabal test all
just hpack          # regenerate .cabal from package.yaml
just format         # ormolu formatting
just ghcid          # continuous compilation
```

PostgreSQL tests require a running instance (`docker compose up -d`). See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for env var details.
